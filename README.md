_The web app accepts the parameters from the user and predicts flower type._

It also displays the probabilities of different where flower can belong. The application has been developed using streamlit web framework. RandomForestClassifier is used to classify the flower into its types. The app has been deployed over Heroku platform.

You can access the application [here](https://blossom-predict.herokuapp.com/).
